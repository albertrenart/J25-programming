‎ 

**VON NEUMANN ARCHITECTURE:**
  
It consists of a single, shared memory for programs and data, a single bus for memory access, an arithmetic unit, and a program control unit.

‎ 

**TYPES OF COMPUTERS:**

- server
- laptop
- tower (PC)
- mobile phone
- smartwatch
- calculator
- console
- television
- home appliance
- router

‎ 

Most of these have a *microcontroller* (for example: calculators, televisions, home appliances).

‎ 

**MICROCONTROLLERS:** Plates or circuits with relatively low processing power. 
- Small
- Cheap
- Low energy consumption

‎ 


**COMPUTERS:**
- Have processors
- Various layers of software
- More processing power

‎ 

**COMPUTER RESOURCES:**
- Processing power
- Memory
- Band width

‎ 

SOME TERMINOLOGY:

- CPU: central processing unit
- GPU: graphic processing unit
- RAM: random acces memory
- RUM: real User Monitoring
- HARDWARE: physical components 
- SOFTWARE: abstract components (can not be touchd): OS, apps...
- FIRMWARE: physical components with an abstract part: BIOS
- RISC: reduced instruction set computing
- CISC: complex instruction set computing


‎ 

**INPUTS & OUTPUTS:**

‎ 

DEFINITION OF OUTPUT: a place where power or information leaves a system.
‎ 
DEFINITION OF INPUT: a place where, or a device through which, energy or information enters a system.
‎ 

*Examples of inputs:*
- Potentiometer
- Button
- Keyboard
- Sensor:
    -	Photosensor
    -	Temperature sensor
    -	Chemical sensors:
          o	pH
          o	Volatile particles
          o	Humidity sensors
- Mouse
- Camera
- Microphone
- Capacitive receiver
- Gyroscope

‎ 


*Examples of output:*
- Screen
- Audio (speaker)
- LEDs
- Motors:
- Pump
- Fan
- Motor vibrador (vibration in controllers, phones, tablets…)


‎ 

*INPUT & OUTPUT IN COMUNICATION:*
- WiFi (internet)
- Bluetooth
- Mobile data (2G, 3G, 4G, 5G)
- LAN (RJ45)
- Telephone / Optic Fiber



‎ 

**IMPORTANT ARCHITECTURES:**
‎ 
*VON NEUMANN:*
It uses one type of memory for instructions and data. 
Most microprocessors of laptops use this kind of architecture.

‎ 

*HARDVARD:*
It distinguishes between memory for instructions and memory for data.

**COMPONENTS OF A PC:**


- POWER SUPPLY: The power supply is responsible for powering the computer.
It does this by converting the alternating current from the plugs into direct current.

‎ 

The most important components of a power supply are: the fan, since it is
a component that gets very hot and needs its own ventilation; the entrance of
electricity; the switching transistors; the coils, which are like filters; the capacitors; the
transformers and the rectifier diodes.

‎ 

- BASE PLATE: The motherboard is one of the most important elements of a computer, since
it is where most of the components are connected. 


‎ 

- CPU: The CPU is one of the most important components of a computer. It is in charge of doing almost all the calculations an tasks (together with the GPU). It also distributes data and information throughout other components.

‎ ‎

- GPU: The graphic card is another key component in a computer. This
processor is in charge of carrying out the operations related to the entire graphic issue.
The biggest difference it has with the CPU is that it is capable of performing many 'easy' operations, while the CPU is not capable of performing as many operations at the same time, but
if it is capable of performing much more complex operations.
‎ 
The graphic card, although I have said that it is very important, it is only important in computers
more potentets, since in low-range, or even mid-range ones, there are times when you choose not to
put them, and integrate it directly into the CPU. This is done to save costs, since the GPU
it is not economical at all and the CPU can be in charge of carrying out graphical operations, if they are not
 very complex.
A modern and powerful GPU has built-in fans, since it gets realy hot.

‎ 


- PCI Card: This is a card for the computer to have an internet connection. Most
 have a port to connect an Ethernet cable, to connect the internet directly via
cable and make the connection faster.

‎ 

- Hard Drive: The hard drive (HDD) is the main memory unit. Its alot
slower than RAM, but has two main advantages:
     - Retains information when the computer is turned off.
     - It has a storage capacity incomparable to RAM.


There is also the SSD memory unit (Solid State Drive), it has the same function, it is more
compact and faster than HDD memory, even so, there are those who prefer hard drives,
because it believes them to be safer.

‎ 


- RAM: It is the temporary memory, it is much faster than the hard drive,
but it only saves information if the computer is on. It is used, for example, to
save information about an application when it is open, so that it runs faster. 

‎ 

*Types of RAM:*
‎ 
- DRAM: Dynamic Random Access Memory is the most used type of RAM in computers.
This type has to be refreshed periodically to maintain the data, since it stores the
information in capacitors, in the form of electrical charge.

‎ 

- SRAM: Static Random Access Memory is faster and more expensive than DRAM. This one does not need to be refreshed periodically. It is much more compact than DRAM.

‎ 

- SDRAM: Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory is like DRAM but synchronizes
your operations with the clock. It is faster than DRAM

‎ 

- DDR SDRAM: Double Data Rate Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory is an evolution of SDRAM, since it is the same but transfers data twice per
each clock cycle.

‎ 
- DDR2 SDRAM: The same as DDR SDRAM but faster and more efficient.
  ‎
  ‎
  

- DDR3 SDRAM: Same but even faster and more efficient.

‎ 
- DDR4 SDRAM: Same, faster, more efficient and more bandwidth than DDR3 SDRAM.

  ‎
  
- DDR5 SDRAM: Even faster, more efficient and more bandwidth than DDR4 SDRAM.
  These are the newest versions that are already coming out.
