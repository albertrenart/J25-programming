‎ 

*HARDVARD:*
It distinguishes between memory for instructions and memory for data.

**COMPONENTS OF A PC:**


- POWER SUPPLY: The power supply is responsible for powering the computer.
It does this by converting the alternating current from the plugs into direct current.

‎ 

The most important components of a power supply are: the fan, since it is
a component that gets very hot and needs its own ventilation; the entrance of
electricity; the switching transistors; the coils, which are like filters; the capacitors; the
transformers and the rectifier diodes.

‎ 

- BASE PLATE: The motherboard is one of the most important elements of a computer, since
it is where most of the components are connected. 


‎ 

- CPU: The CPU is one of the most important components of a computer. It is in charge of doing almost all the calculations an tasks (together with the GPU). It also distributes data and information throughout other components.

‎ ‎

- GPU: The graphic card is another key component in a computer. This
processor is in charge of carrying out the operations related to the entire graphic issue.
The biggest difference it has with the CPU is that it is capable of performing many 'easy' operations, while the CPU is not capable of performing as many operations at the same time, but
if it is capable of performing much more complex operations.
‎ 
The graphic card, although I have said that it is very important, it is only important in computers
more potentets, since in low-range, or even mid-range ones, there are times when you choose not to
put them, and integrate it directly into the CPU. This is done to save costs, since the GPU
it is not economical at all and the CPU can be in charge of carrying out graphical operations, if they are not
 very complex.
A modern and powerful GPU has built-in fans, since it gets realy hot.

‎ 


- PCI Card: This is a card for the computer to have an internet connection. Most
 have a port to connect an Ethernet cable, to connect the internet directly via
cable and make the connection faster.

‎ 

- Hard Drive: The hard drive (HDD) is the main memory unit. Its alot
slower than RAM, but has two main advantages:
     - Retains information when the computer is turned off.
     - It has a storage capacity incomparable to RAM.


There is also the SSD memory unit (Solid State Drive), it has the same function, it is more
compact and faster than HDD memory, even so, there are those who prefer hard drives,
because it believes them to be safer.

‎ 


- RAM: It is the temporary memory, it is much faster than the hard drive,
but it only saves information if the computer is on. It is used, for example, to
save information about an application when it is open, so that it runs faster. 

‎ 

*Types of RAM:*
‎ 
- DRAM: Dynamic Random Access Memory is the most used type of RAM in computers.
This type has to be refreshed periodically to maintain the data, since it stores the
information in capacitors, in the form of electrical charge.

‎ 

- SRAM: Static Random Access Memory is faster and more expensive than DRAM. This one does not need to be refreshed periodically. It is much more compact than DRAM.

‎ 

- SDRAM: Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory is like DRAM but synchronizes
your operations with the clock. It is faster than DRAM

‎ 

- DDR SDRAM: Double Data Rate Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory is an evolution of SDRAM, since it is the same but transfers data twice per
each clock cycle.

‎ 
- DDR2 SDRAM: The same as DDR SDRAM but faster and more efficient.
  ‎
  ‎
  

- DDR3 SDRAM: Same but even faster and more efficient.

‎ 
- DDR4 SDRAM: Same, faster, more efficient and more bandwidth than DDR3 SDRAM.

  ‎
  
- DDR5 SDRAM: Even faster, more efficient and more bandwidth than DDR4 SDRAM.
  These are the newest versions that are already coming out.

## ‎NUMERIC SYSTEMS



To specify the base of a number, we add a subscript:


![image](https://github.com/albertrenart/J25-programming/assets/144990839/589c459f-45cc-4ce9-8d11-1038865ec48d)

‎ 

**BINARY**
‎ 
‎ 

Definition: The binary system is a numeric system in which all numbers are represented using a base of two numbers: zero and one. In other words, it is a base 2 numeric system, while the system we most commonly use is base 10.
‎ 

Example:
‎ 
‎ 
0 --> 0

1 --> 01

2 --> 10

3 --> 11

4 --> 100

5 --> 101

6 --> 110

7 --> 111

8 --> 1000

9 --> 1001

10 --> 1010

11 --> 1011


‎ 

1 bit --> information core with two possible values (0, 1)
8 bits --> 1 byte (28 possible values)
1KByte --> 1KB --> 1024 bytes = 210 bytes

‎ ‎ 



*Storage capacity:*
‎ 
Bit --> 2 posibilidades


1 Byte = 8 bits --> 2^8 posibilidades  hasta 256 elementos diferentes

‎ 


¡¡¡¡ DO NOT CONFUSE KB (Kilo Byte) WITH Kb (Kilo bit) !!!

‎ ‎ 
 
**Advantages & disadvantages:**
‎ 
- It is easy to make a binary electronic circuit
  
- Arithmetic operations are longer but simpler
  
- Binary numbers are long --> making them difficult for humans to use

‎ 
‎ 
‎ 
‎ 

To transform a number from decimal to binary:

- Divide by 2 until reaching 0:

## MARKUP LANGUAGES (and webs)


‎ 

**WHAT IS A MARKUP LANGUAGE?**
‎ 


A markup language is a computer laguage which uses tags to mark different parts of a code, to define what it does.


The markup itself usually consists of a collection of pre-made codes or tags that are inserted into the document's text. These tags indicate how different elements should be presented (font size, color, alignment, etc.) and describe the document's structure (headings, paragraphs, lists, etc.).

They clasify information.


‎ 

**- HTML**


Stands for: Hyper text markout language

HTML is a marking language designed to structure texts and relate them in hypertext form. It is used to create, mainly, webpages.

‎ 

*A basic scheme:*

<!DOCTYPE html>
<HTML>
	<HEAD>
		<TITLE> Mi pagina
			</TITLE>
		</HEAD>
		<BODY>
			Mi primera pagina>
		</BODY>
</HTML>

‎ 

*MOST USED TAGS:*
<br>   -->  enter 
<b>    -->  bold
<i>    -->  italic
<img src>   -->   image
<p>  -->  parrafo    | inside of <p>: </p> style = “font-size”>
<u> --> underlined
<div>  


‎ 

An example of my first webpage I did:

### STATIC AND DYNAMIC WEBS

‎ 

**STATIC:**

- Static web pages are what you see is what you get.
- Made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
- They almost always stay the same.

‎ 

*Advantages & disadvantages:*

- Fast loading speeds.
- Simple to maintain.
- Not Super Interactive.

  ‎ 

*EXAMPLES:*

- [Space Jam Web](https://www.spacejam.com/1996/jam.htm)
- [David Prieto Web](https://fabacademy.org/2020/labs/barcelona/students/david-prieto/)

‎

‎ 


**DYNAMIC:**

- Made by the server in real time depending on user actions.
- They mainly run on PHP, Python, Ruby. 

‎ 

*Advantages & disadvantages:*

- Personalized Content.
- They can talk to databases to grab or store info.
- Interactive and Fun.
- Harder to maintain.

  ‎

‎ 
‎ 

## NETWORKS

‎ 
**Architecture:**

 - Client-server

‎ 


Client computer --> requests

Server Computer --> responds with an HTML


‎ 


¡¡¡IMPORTANT!!!

A link (enlace) it's not the same as a URL.

A link is what you click (can be a text, an image, a button...).

The URL is the actual route.


‎ 

‎ 
URL: Uniform Resource Locator.

‎ 
‎ 
*Parts of a URL:*

![image](https://github.com/albertrenart/J25-programming/assets/144990839/9c2ce28f-c232-4741-a494-5f42ff1ed4ba)

‎ 

Inside the domain there is an IP (Internet Protocol acces)


To transalte domains and IPs, a DNS (domain name server) is needed.


‎ 


*Internet:*

Physical network of interconnected computers (Hardware)

‎ 

*WWW (World Wide Web):*

Resources (software, data) stored on the internet


‎ 


Wifi: Server <--> ISP (Internet Service Provider) <--> router <--> acces point <--> maquina

This route goes back and forth.

‎ 


Las ISP’s son de la compañía (movistar, Orange…)



**PROTOCOL:**

Laws in communication -->  https:// (hyper text transfer protocol secured)

‎ 
‎ 

### IT

‎ 

INFORMATICA Y TELECOMUNICACIONES

‎ 
‎ 
**TASKS:**

‎ 

- Project Manager
  
- Web Developer:
    - Front end (what the user sees)
    - Back end (what the user does not see)
    - Full stack (both)
 

-	Programmer (analyst, revises and designs / like an arquitect) 
  
- QA (quality Assurance / revises the program)
  
- DBA (data base admin)

‎ 

**ENVIRONMENTS:**

Definition: A Programming Environment is the collection of tools used in the development of software.‎ 

‎ 


- Local Environment: Developer's computer.

- INT (integration): Integration of programs with others.

- PRE (pre-production): Staging / testing / QA is here.

- PRO (production): Launch / public



‎ 

**AND REMEMBER, DO NOT LAUNCH ON PRO ON FRIDAY**


Many bugs and problems can occur. If this happens, there are to options (neither of them is a pleasing one):

- Make your workers stay working until late on a friday.

- Cancel the launch until monday, and ruin all the expectations of your users.
