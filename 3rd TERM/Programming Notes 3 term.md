## HARDWARE & SOFTWARE

**VON NEUMANN ARCHITECTURE:**
  
It consists of a single, shared memory for programs and data, a single bus for memory access, an arithmetic unit, and a program control unit.

‎ 

**TYPES OF COMPUTERS:**

- server
- laptop
- tower (PC)
- mobile phone
- smartwatch
- calculator
- console
- television
- home appliance
- router

‎ 

Most of these have a *microcontroller* (for example: calculators, televisions, home appliances).

‎ 

**MICROCONTROLLERS:** Plates or circuits with relatively low processing power. 
- Small
- Cheap
- Low energy consumption

‎ 


**COMPUTERS:**
- Have processors
- Various layers of software
- More processing power

‎ 

**COMPUTER RESOURCES:**
- Processing power
- Memory
- Band width

‎ 

SOME TERMINOLOGY:

- CPU: central processing unit
- GPU: graphic processing unit
- RAM: random acces memory
- RUM: real User Monitoring
- HARDWARE: physical components 
- SOFTWARE: abstract components (can not be touchd): OS, apps...
- FIRMWARE: physical components with an abstract part: BIOS
- RISC: reduced instruction set computing
- CISC: complex instruction set computing


‎
