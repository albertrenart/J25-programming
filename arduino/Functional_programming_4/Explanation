What this program does is to blink my name in the Arduino LED. We will use a different function for each letter. 
Also, we will use the function morseBlink, instead of dotDuration.
In the setup, it determines where to send the code (to the LED).
In the loop, we only have the function for each letter and a delay because of the end of a word (Albert).
