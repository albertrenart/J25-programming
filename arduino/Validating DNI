The DNI consists of eight digits and a letter. The numbers are what really identifies you, and the letter is a validation character. The letter is used to validate if the number you have
submitted is correct. The way it works is the following: 

You take the eight digits of the DNI number, then you divide the whole number by 23, and depending of the reminder you get, the DNI gets a different letter.
This is the list of letters related to the remainders:

- Remainder 0: T
- Remainder 1: R
- Remainder 2: W
- Remainder 3: A
- Remainder 4: G
- Remainder 5: M
- Remainder 6: Y
- Remainder 7: F
- Remainder 8: P
- Remainder 9: D
- Remainder 10: X
- Remainder 11: B
- Remainder 12: N
- Remainder 13: J
- Remainder 14: Z
- Remainder 15: S
- Remainder 16: Q
- Remainder 17: V
- Remainder 18: H
- Remainder 19: L
- Remainder 20: C
- Remainder 21: K
- Remainder 22: E


Knowing this, to create a new DNI you have to create a number of eight digits, divide it by 23, and add a letter at the end depending of the reminder you get. I haven't find 
information about which numbers are used and which not, so to create a DNI not currently in use I don't know the method.
